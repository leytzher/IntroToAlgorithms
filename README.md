# Intro to Algorithms ðŸ”¥

This is code from "Introduction to Algorithms" or CLRS.

My objective is to learn C programming while also learning about useful algorithms.

## Implemented (so far)
-  ![Insertion sort](https://github.com/leytzher/IntroToAlgorithms/tree/main/sorting-algorithms/insertion-sort)
- Merge sort ![](https://github.com/leytzher/IntroToAlgorithms/tree/main/sorting-algorithms/merge-sort)
- Heap sort ![](https://github.com/leytzher/IntroToAlgorithms/tree/main/sorting-algorithms/heapsort)
- Priority Queues (Max-priority) ![](https://github.com/leytzher/IntroToAlgorithms/tree/main/sorting-algorithms/priority-queues) [Work In Progress)
