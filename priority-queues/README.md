# Priority Queues

This is one of the most popular applications of a heap. 

There are max-priority queues and min-priority queues.

## Max Priority queues

This is a data structure that can be used to schedule jobs on a shared computer. It keeps track of the jobs to be performed and their relative priority. When a job is finished (or interrupted), the scheduler selects the highest priority job from among those pending jobs.
